##Tic Tac Toe
Game I made using java programming language, it has one player, and a small 3x3 game board, players can input a number to place their mark on the game board. Currently it doesn't have a win condition or lose.

##Bank Account
Simple console Program made using Java language, the program begins by asking for the user to choose if they want to create, view, deposit, or exit program. Create will prompt the user for their name and initial deposit amount, it will then auto generate an account number from which you can use to view the account or deposit to the account.
